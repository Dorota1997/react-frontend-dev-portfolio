      "role": "I began my journey at ViaLeads as a Full Stack developer, but my skills and expertise led me to become the Front-End lead for the project. One of the major challenges I faced while working on ViaLeads was integrating new features on top of an existing database. Another challenge was developing the Auto Mode feature that distributes tasks to agents based on various factors such as scheduling, priority, and recall. Lastly, creating dynamic scripts and forms that adapt to the client's phone call responses was also a complex task that I overcame through my strong problem-solving skills.",

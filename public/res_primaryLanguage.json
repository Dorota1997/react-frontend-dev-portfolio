Online resources are either paywalled or are found in pdf files that are difficult to interact with in a virtual setting. Kiija is a solution to my teaching problem and is designed to help students learn by repitition and practice without all of the messy overhead. Currently I only support Addition and Subtraction but am actively working on adding Mulitplication, Division, and Alegbra topics. Additional future work will involve expanding subject coverage to Geometry, Calculus, and more!",

This change was driven by my passion for problem solving and the desire to create something meaningful. My background in theatre and hospitality gives me a unique advantage in forging connections with new people and delivering unparalleled customer service, and during my time at General Assembly I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python with a focus on the MERN tech stack.",

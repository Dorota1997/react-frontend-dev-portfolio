        "description": "ViaLeads is a 100% cloud-based solution that combines multiple predictive dialers and a scripting tool designed for call centers. It automates your inbound and outbound call campaigns, provides real-time production monitoring, and offers customizable supervision screens. ViaLeads is equipped with powerful call engines, including preview, progressive, predictive, and click-to-call. It also offers on-demand, scheduled, or random recording, campaign reports, and detailed statistics by agent, group, service, hour, day, and month.",
        "role": "I began my journey at ViaLeads as a Full Stack developer, but my skills and expertise led me to become the Front-End lead for the project. One of the major challenges I faced while working on ViaLeads was integrating new features on top of an existing database. Another challenge was developing the Auto Mode feature that distributes tasks to agents based on various factors such as scheduling, priority, and recall. Lastly, creating dynamic scripts and forms that adapt to the client's phone call responses was also a complex task that I overcame through my strong problem-solving skills.",

As the project progressed, I transitioned to a fully front-end role. The team faced a number of challenges, such as implementing the brainstorming feature, integrating Zoom for live streaming within the app, and incorporating Stripe for payments - which was my first time using it. However, with the collective effort of our team and extensive research, we were able to overcome these challenges and deliver a successful project.",

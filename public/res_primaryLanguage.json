They were designed to be 10-15 minute group activites to grab the students attention and make them excited about class. The games were usually played in teams that competed. Each of the games had offline interactions in mind to facilite practicing English. For example, the board game was played amongst a class of 50 students. The student taking their team's turn could call out a student in the class to ask the question to or force them to do what the game prompts said. I created every game individually over 3-4 years and finally compiled them into one UI. ESL Games Collection was Designed to run on low end Windows PCs with a 4:3 resolution because that is what classrooms have in China. The WebGL version was created for demo purposes only, and contains many bugs. Please download the Windows .exe version to get the intended experience.",

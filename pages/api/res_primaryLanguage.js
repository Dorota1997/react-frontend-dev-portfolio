    bio: "ðŸ‘‹ I am Sean Redmon, an enthusiastic teacher and software developer. I gained a passion for development while I was working at an English school in China. I saw many problems that could be solved with software. My apps have helped students and teachers to be more effective inside and outside the classroom. Seeing my students enjoy my apps in class always motivated me to create more and learn more. During my 7 years in China, I saw a huge shift in the education industry towards online learning. China has over 400 million students learning English, which is more than the entire population of the USA. There will simply never be enough English teachers. I have since returned home to pursue web development full time. Someday I hope to create my own online learning platform with the invaluable experienced I got in China.",

The site has been used to sell tickets, promote Donnie's theater plays, weekly performances and streaming platform specials. Donniefan.com has helped Donnie launch his North American tour. This site was invaluable in presenting him to clubs and venues who may not know him outside of China. Currently this site ranks #1 for the search term Donnie Fan.

I translated his minimalistic branding into a modern site that has that old school local pizza place vibe, while still feeling like a modern web app. Mike's previous website was difficult to change and he always had to waste time phoning up the developer to make pricing changes and other small changes. I build him a minimalistic CMS that he can make changes with in minutes.",

I chose to use Firebase for authentication because its very secure and saved a lot of dev time. Currently the live site is under construction as I have since learned more about proper data structures. The original app was not scalable and would download the entire database before the first paint. This is obviously not ideal.

    bio: "ðŸ‘‹ I am Sean Redmon, an enthusiastic teacher and software developer. I got into development while I was working at an English school in China. I saw many problems that could be solved with software, so I created apps to help students learn inside and outside the classroom. I also created apps to help other teachers do their jobs more effieciently. I always found it extremely rewarding to create an app and see the enjoyment my students got from it. This motivated me to continue learning more and improving. During my 7 years in China, I saw a huge shift in the education industry towards online learning. The supply of foreign teachers simply will never meet the huge demand from students and schools. I have since return home to pursue web development full time. Someday I hope to create my own online learning platform with the invaluable experienced I got in China.",

        "An original website for the China based comedian Donnie Fan. I worked directly with Donnie and created a Figma design that fits his needs. I coded and put the site online for the client. This was my first freelance project. I learned a lot about the process of getting a site live. It was an invaluable experience working with a real client. I learned how to communicate expectations, timelines, pricing and how to find the right design for their needs. The site has evolved over time, as Donnie has started touring and writing plays. I am still currently maintaining and updating this site. In 2022 the site was rebuilt with NextJS to serve static HTML pages that google can crawl easier. Currently this site ranks #1 for the search term donnie fan ",

They had to have their parents help them read it or help them play the CD that came with the book. The students who had very attentive parents had a huge unfair advantage over other students. So I created an android app that students could use at home without their parents help. The students can browse the book and click the music icons to hear the CD audio play. Teachers could also benefit from this app during class. This app also would run on the classroom smartboards. Teachers no longer had to make powerpoints of book pages and didn't have to waste class time trying to find the correct audio file on the CD. In a fast paced ESL classroom, you quickly lose the energy of the class by fumbling with a CD player. The app has touch controls. You can zoom in and pan the screen. You can also swipe to turn the page.",

        "This is a compilation of all the games I created for the smartboard in my ESL classroom in China. These games were originally stand alone games. Each game was created to be used alongside a lesson. Most of them were meant to help students memorize vocabulary. The UI is divided into the Kid's Beginner A book and B book, and then by units 1-16. Each Game pulls from the same global word list. Each unit has a wordlist and phonics wordlist that corresponds to the books. Students who had the Android app could touch the words and hear it read to them. This was a much easier way to practice the words at home than using the CD that the books came with. This way students could practice without their parent's help. The Chinese education system is heavily centered around memorizing large volumes of information and then repeating it back. This app streamlined this process inside and outside the classroom. To use the app simply choose a unit and then press the menu button at the top left corner. You will see a list of the games for that unit, as well as the option to choose between different word lists. You can choose phonics words, vocabulary words, or both. On the top right hand corner you can globally turn off the background music for all games. You can restart the current game with the restart button. Opening this menu will always pause the current game.",

        "An original website for the China based comedian Donnie Fan. I worked directly with Donnie and created a Figma design that fits his needs. I coded and put the site online for the client. This was my first freelance project. I learned a lot about the process of getting a site live. It was an invaluable experience working with a real client. I learned how to communicate expectations, timelines, pricing and how to find the right design for their needs. The site has evolved over time, as Donnie has started touring and writing plays. I am still currently maintaining and updating this site. In 2022 the site was rebuilt with NextJS to serve static HTML pages that google can crawl easier. Currently this site ranks #1 for the search term donnie fan ",

The games were usually played in teams that competed. Each of the games had offline interactions in mind to facilite practicing English. For example, the dice roll board game was played amongst a class of 50 students. The student taking their team's turn could call out a student in the class to ask the question to or force them to do what the game prompts said. I created every game individually over 2-3 years and finally compiled them into one UI. ESL Games Collection was Designed to run on low end Windows PCs with a 4:3 resolution because that is what classrooms have in China. The WebGL version was created for demo purposes only, and contains many bugs. Please download the Windows .exe version to get the intended experience.",
